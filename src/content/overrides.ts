/**
 * Corrections applied on top of `pages.json`.
 *
 * `pages.json` is a mirror of the live WordPress site: `npm run content`
 * rewrites it wholesale from `.cache/html`, so anything typed into it by hand
 * is lost on the next regeneration. Two kinds of change therefore live here.
 *
 * Most of it is what the **client** asked for and the live site has not made
 * yet — new prices, two retired wash packages, a renamed add-on.
 *
 * The rest is what **this build does better than the mirror** and the mirror
 * would undo: the hero video is transcoded here, and the mirror only knows the
 * source `.mov`.
 *
 * Rules are therefore written against the *shape* of the content ("the four
 * price headings after the TRITON heading"), never against array indices,
 * which a regeneration would shift.
 *
 * Source: "Website changes.docx", 2026-09-06. The item number in each rule's
 * comment is that document's numbering.
 *
 * When the live site catches up, delete the rule rather than editing it: the
 * next `npm run content` will bring the same value in from the mirror.

    "unpleasant and lingering pet odours" and listed steam cleaning and
    sanitation in the package, which the brief's list of claims to remove
    names one by one.
