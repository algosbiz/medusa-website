/**
 * Corrections applied on top of `pages.json`.
 *
 * `pages.json` is a mirror of the live WordPress site: `npm run content`
 * rewrites it wholesale from `.cache/html`, so anything typed into it by hand
 * is lost on the next regeneration. Two kinds of change therefore live here.
 *
 * Most of it is what the **client** asked for and the live site has not made
 * yet — new prices, two retired wash packages, a renamed add-on.
 *
 * The rest is what **this build does better than the mirror** and the mirror
 * would undo: the hero video is transcoded here, and the mirror only knows the
 * source `.mov`.
 *
 * Rules are therefore written against the *shape* of the content ("the four
 * price headings after the TRITON heading"), never against array indices,
 * which a regeneration would shift.
 *
 * Source: "Website changes.docx", 2026-09-06. The item number in each rule's
 * comment is that document's numbering.
 *
 * When the live site catches up, delete the rule rather than editing it: the
 * next `npm run content` will bring the same value in from the mirror.
