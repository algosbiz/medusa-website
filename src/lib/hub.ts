/**
 * The model behind a **menu-group hub** — a page for one column of the Services
 * mega-menu, listing the services under it.
 *
 * Two of these exist: `/repairs` and `/car-interior-cleaning`. Neither has an
 * entry in `pages.json`, because neither exists on the live site; the client
 * asked for them — "a page for /Repairs will need to be created, which will
 * have links that go to its childs… since repairs is a master page, it would
 * follow a similar layout to the other master pages" (2026-09-15), then "one
 * more master page to create, with links on the master page going to its
 * childs" against the Interior Cleaning column (2026-09-16).
 *
 * **Almost every word on one is read back out of the pages it links to.** Rule
 * 8.1 forbids writing copy to fill a page, so nothing here is authored: the
 * names come from the client's own menu, the blurbs are each page's own opening
 * paragraph, the prices are each page's own price ladder, the reasons and the
 * questions are sections those pages already carry, and the photographs are
 * the ones they already run. Add a service to a menu group and it appears on
 * that group's hub with its own copy; change a price on a service page and the
 * hub follows.
 *
 * The client also set the pricing rule: "if there are prices on those 4 sub
 * pages, then those prices can go onto the master page /repairs. If there are
 * no prices, then yeah then there would be a contact us or qoute button."
 * `HubCard.priceFrom` is therefore optional and the card falls back to the
 * quote button — two of the four repairs quote nothing, and four of the eight
 * interior services.
 *
 * `lib/hubs.ts` holds the two specs; this file is the machinery.
