/**
 * JSON-LD for every page, built to the rules in `medusa-schema/CLAUDE.md`.
 *
 * **One block, one `@graph`, per page.** A node is DEFINED once, on the page
 * that page is about, and REFERENCED from every other page **written out in
 * full** — a bare `{ "@id": … }` resolves only against the same page's graph,
 * and nothing fetches another page to follow a pointer. That is why
 * `businessRef()` exists and is not padding.
 *
 * Every `@id` comes from `medusa-schema/ids.ts`. Never build one by template
 * here: the area ids are not uniform, so a template that looks right on one
 * page is wrong on another.
 *
 * Replaced the Yoast-shaped graph on 2026-10-09. Five defects went with it:
 * `#organization` (collapsed into `#business`), the business node sitting in a
 * second script block where nothing could reference it, its bare-root `@id`,
 * an `openingHours` string holding two ranges and so not parsing, and
 * `areaServed: ["GB"]` on the contact point.
