/**
 * "Our … Services" — the hub's card grid, on the four service pages that are
 * not hubs.
 *
 * Client, 2026-09-22, listing URLs under each of four headings — "On
 * /mobile-car-wash — add these 3 services:", the same for /car-detailing,
 * /car-valeting and /commercial-valeting — and then, over a screenshot of
 * `/repairs`: "And in, the same way you did for repairs page".
 *
 * **Each list is exactly what the page was missing.** Checked against the
 * rendered pages that day: /mobile-car-wash linked silver, gold, platinum and
 * exterior-plus and nothing else — bronze and exterior wash are the two tiers
 * `overrides.ts` retires from its price row — /car-valeting linked five of its
 * seven, /car-detailing five of its eight, and /commercial-valeting none of
 * its three. So a card here never repeats a package the page already sells;
 * it closes the hole between the menu column and the page under it.
 *
 * **Nothing is written.** `cardsFrom` in `lib/hub.ts` builds the same card a
 * hub builds — the menu's own label, the page's own opening paragraph, its own
 * entry price, its own photograph — so a price change on a service page
 * follows here, and a card is one shape wherever it appears. The only string
 * in this file is each section's heading, which is the pattern the client
 * approved on `/repairs`: "Our <the menu's name for the group> Services".
