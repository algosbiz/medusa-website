/**
 * The breadcrumb trail every page's `BreadcrumbList` is built from.
 *
 * The mirror's own trails cannot be used as they stand. WordPress published
 * every page one level below Home, so 294 of the 313 two-segment URLs came
 * back as `Home > Page` — `/car-detailing/watford` never named `/car-detailing`
 * — and the names are the WordPress titles from before the client renamed and
 * re-parented the pages: `/car-detailing/alloy-wheel-protection` was "Wheeluv",
 * `/mobile-car-wash/car-wax-service` "Autoglym", and thirteen carried an HTML
 * entity such as `&#038;`, which JSON-LD does not decode.
 *
 * So the hierarchy is read off the URL, which since 2026-09-15 is the site's
 * real structure, and the names off the client's own menu. Nothing is written:
 *
 *   - **Parent** — the nearest path prefix that is a page. Blog posts are the
 *     one exception: `/2025/07/26/…` has no page at any of its date segments,
 *     and the page that lists them is `/blog`.
 *   - **Name** — the page's label in `NAV`, where the menu names it; otherwise
 *     the tail of the source's own trail with its entities decoded; otherwise
 *     the page's h1. Top-level menu labels are skipped — "About" and
 *     "Commercial & Fleet" name a menu, not a page.
 *
 * `page.breadcrumb` itself is left alone: `nameReadMoreLinks` reads its tail
 * for visible button labels, and the site renders no visible breadcrumb.
