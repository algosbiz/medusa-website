/**
 * The frame every service page shares.
 *
 * Forty-one pages sit under the Valeting, Detailing, Mobile Car Wash and More
 * Services menus, and they are all built the same way: a title, an opening
 * paragraph or standfirst, "What's included", a vehicle-class price ladder,
 * "+ Add-on services", a photo strip, "AREAS WE PROVIDE …" and sometimes an
 * FAQ. Rendered block-by-block that comes out as one flat scroll opening on a
 * bare heading — no header, the price several screens down, the coverage list
 * stranded under the photographs and the questions after it.
 *
 * This reads the shape a page already has and hands `components/ServicePage`
 * the four pieces the frame needs: the opening copy, the entry price, the
 * coverage list and the questions. **Nothing is rewritten and nothing is
 * dropped** — every block the frame does not claim is passed through to the
 * ordinary renderer in document order, and a page that matches none of these
 * shapes simply keeps its whole body and gets a header with its title in it.
 *
 * `lib/headlight.ts` and `lib/motorcycle.ts` are the other end of the same
 * idea: one page, copy transcribed by hand, layout written from scratch. That
 * is worth it for a page the extractor mangled. These extract cleanly — what
 * they lack is a frame.

 * `/headlight-restoration`, `/motorcycle-valeting-detailing` and
 * `/car-lovers-club`, which have hand-built routes of their own.
