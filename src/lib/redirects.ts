/**
 * Every URL that no longer serves a page, and where it goes instead.
 *
 * Most of it is the old WordPress site, from the "301 redirects" tab of the
 * Menu update workbook - 75 rules, one per row - plus WordPress's own archive
 * URLs. Then this clone's own history: two menu groups moved on 2026-09-15 at
 * the client's request, and those URLs have been live here long enough to be
 * worth keeping. Then the 127 location moves, which are not written out here
 * at all - see the note above them.
 *
 * **The client's "Medusa redirect list" sheet (2026-09-19) is the authority**,
 * now that the site answers on its own domain rather than a preview one. Its
 * 262 rows were checked against this table row by row: 211 are genuine
 * redirects and every one of them is here, with the same destination; the other
 * 51 name a page that still exists and differ only by the trailing slash the
 * sheet's left column carries, which Next normalises without a rule. The 12
 * rules below that the sheet does not mention are this clone's own
 * (`/ceramic-coating/*`, `/car-detailing/*` -> `/repairs/*`, and
 * `/car-interior-cleaning/premium-interior-wash`): URLs that only ever existed
 * on this build, so no sheet about the WordPress site would list them, and
 * dropping them would 404 something that shipped. The sheet's own
 * `/premium-interior-wash` row now lands on the page's 2026-09-26 URL rather
 * than the one the sheet names.
 *
 * **Every path here is written without a trailing slash**, which is the form
 * these rules are matched against: `trailingSlash` is off, so Next normalises
 * `/valeting/` to `/valeting` before it consults this table. The workbook wrote
 * them the other way round, the way WordPress publishes them, and a rule that
 * kept the sheet's slash would simply never fire.
 *
 * No source appears twice and no destination is itself a source, so none of
 * these can chain. That is why the 2026-09-15 move also rewrote the
 * destinations above it rather than pointing them at a URL that now redirects.
 *
 * `next.config.ts` turns these into permanent redirects. The sitemap and the
 * blog index read the same list so that neither ever advertises a URL that
 * only redirects - drop a rule here and the page returns to both on its own.
