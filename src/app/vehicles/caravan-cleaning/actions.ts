/**
 * The caravan & motorhome valeting quote form's action — schema, rules and
 * email in `lib/caravan-quote.ts`, the form in `components/
 * CaravanQuoteForm.tsx`.
 *
 * The same gates as every form on the site (`lib/form-delivery.ts`): the
 * honeypot, the form's own rules — re-run here, so a tampered submission is
 * held to them — the photographs, Turnstile, then delivery to the inbox and
 * the webhook. The email is the brief's "QUOTE FORM BACK-END": its subject
 * line, its list of what to include, every photograph, and the telephone
 * number as a link.
 *
 * Never submit this against `npm run dev` with `.env.local` in place: it
 * holds the live SendGrid key, and a test would email the client.
