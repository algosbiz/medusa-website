/**
 * Incremental Static Regeneration, for every route under this layout.
 *
 * Set here rather than on 255 page files: a `revalidate` on a layout is the
 * default for its whole subtree, and the lowest value across a route wins, so
 * a page that needs to refresh faster can still say so itself.
 *
 * What it buys, concretely:
 *
 * - Pages are served from the prerender cache and revalidated in the
 *   background at most once an hour, so a visitor never waits on a render.
 * - Next sends `Cache-Control: s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate` with
 *   them, which is what a CDN in front of this needs in order to hold them.
 * - `revalidatePath` can flush one page, or all of them, without a redeploy —
 *   see `app/api/revalidate/route.ts`.
 *
 * An hour rather than a minute because the content behind these pages is a
 * build artefact (`src/content/pages.json`), not a live feed: see the note in
 * PROJECT.md about what a regeneration can and cannot pick up.
 *
 * Development ignores this entirely — `next dev` re-renders every request.
