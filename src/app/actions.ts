/**
 * Handles every enquiry form on the site. The posted `__slug`/`__form` pair
 * identifies which form it is; the schema is then re-read server-side so a
 * tampered payload can't bypass the required-field rules.
 *
 * Three gates, cheapest first: the honeypot, then Turnstile, then the form's
 * own required-field rules. The order matters — a bot should cost a token
 * check at most, and a person who mistypes an email address should not have
 * spent their Turnstile token on it.
 *
 * Delivery is email through SendGrid, to the inbox the site publishes
 * (`lib/mail.ts`), plus a POST to CONTACT_WEBHOOK_URL if one is configured —
 * the two are independent sinks and an enquiry counts as delivered if either
 * took it. With neither configured the enquiry is logged instead, which is
 * fine in development and a hard error in production, because quietly
 * thanking someone whose message went nowhere is worse than telling them to
 * phone.
