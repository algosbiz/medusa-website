/**
 * The car graffiti removal quote form on /repairs/car-graffiti-removal.
 *
 * Its own action for its own schema (`lib/graffiti-quote.ts`): multi-select
 * groups, questions asked only after a "Yes", up to ten photographs in one
 * field — "Photos should be mandatory" — and an email the brief writes out
 * line by line: its subject, its order, and a telephone number that can be
 * tapped. The same gates, in the same order, as the signage removal quote
 * form: the honeypot, the answers and the photographs, Turnstile, then
 * `deliver`.
 *
 * The photographs travel in the form's order, named `photo-1-…` so the inbox
 * lists them the way the customer chose them; those every mail client can
 * draw are shown in the body as well ("ALL uploaded photographs"), and a HEIC
 * is attached only.
