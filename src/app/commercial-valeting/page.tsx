/**
 * Fleet and commercial, laid out rather than rendered.
 *
 * Two problems on the extracted page. The obvious one is shape: three long
 * paragraphs beside a 2,560px photograph, then a heading, then a form.
 *
 * The other one is a hole. The source lists the nine kinds of fleet it cleans
 * as a three-by-three grid of tick marks with the label beside each one, and
 * those labels live in bare `<div class="iwt-text">` elements the extractor
 * has no branch for — so `pages.json` holds nine tick images in a row and not
 * one word of what they were ticking. `FLEET` below restores them from
 * `.cache/html/commercial-valeting-and-detailing.html`, verbatim and in the
 * source's order; everything else on this page is its own copy, unchanged.
