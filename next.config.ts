    No `trailingSlash`, so Next's default stands: /mobile-car-wash/bronze-wash/
    redirects to /mobile-car-wash/bronze-wash, and the short form is what every
    canonical, every sitemap entry and every internal link on the site says.

    Client, 2026-09-19: "I think URLs without a trailing dash is better".

    The redirect table below answers **301**. It answered 308 until 2026-10-06
    — `permanent: true`, which is what that flag means in Next — and search
    engines treat the two the same, but the client's brief for the alloy wheel
    move said it twice: "Use ONE server-side permanent 301", and "Check old
    URL returns: 301 not 302". A 308 reads as neither to anyone checking with a
    header tool, so `statusCode: 301` is set rather than the flag. Every page
    here is a GET, which is the one case where the two codes cannot differ.

    The trailing-slash normalisation above is still a **308**: it is Next's
    own and no config reaches it.

    Two things follow from dropping the slash, both handled rather than
    inherited:

    - **The redirect table is written without slashes** (`lib/redirects.ts`).
      Next resolves the trailing-slash normalisation before it consults that
      table, so `/valeting/` arrives at it as `/valeting`; a rule still wearing
      the workbook's slash would never match anything.
    - **A legacy WordPress URL now takes two hops.** `/valeting/` 308s to
      `/valeting` and then 301s to `/car-valeting`. That is the cost of the
      switch and it is paid by inbound links only: nothing this site renders
      points at a slashed URL any more, so no internal link and no sitemap
      entry chains. Removing the extra hop would mean `skipTrailingSlashRedirect`
      and a proxy to do the normalising by hand, which puts a function in front
      of 305 static pages to save a crawler one redirect it already follows.

    Next's image optimiser is off, and this is a billing decision rather than a
    technical one.

    Vercel's Image Optimization quota ran out, so every /_next/image request
    answered `402 OPTIMIZED_IMAGE_REQUEST_PAYMENT_REQUIRED` - 99 bytes of plain
    text where a photograph should be. Because every `next/image` on the site
    routes through it, that emptied all 525 images on all 254 pages at once,
    while the files themselves kept serving fine from /assets.

    Unoptimised, `next/image` emits a plain <img> pointing at the file on disk.
    What that costs is per-viewport resizing, not format: the assets are
    mirrored from WordPress and are already .webp at a median of 54 KB, so a
    phone now fetches the desktop-sized file. /mobile-car-wash is the heaviest
    case at 21 images totalling 0.97 MB.

    Delete this block the moment the plan is upgraded or the quota resets;
    nothing else has to change.

    directory: a dated path, written once by `npm run content` and then left

    default, so all 37 images on the homepage were revalidated on every
    repeat visit - Pingdom grades that "Add Expires headers: D".

    A month of freshness with a year of stale-while-revalidate: a replaced
    file still reaches a returning visitor, it just does so on the next

    The enquiry forms are server actions, and one of them — the caravan page's

    default, which no phone photograph is under, so that field has never
    worked: the whole submission failed before the action was reached, with
    the name, the address and the message in it.

    4 MB rather than more, because Vercel's own function request limit is
    4.5 MB and a limit set above it would fail one layer further out, where
    this file cannot say anything about it. The multipart encoding adds its
    own 10-20 KB of boundaries on top of the file, hence the gap.

    `lib/mail.ts` carries the matching attachment budget.
